# Console-Based-Notepad-using-Trie-Trees

There are 4 header files and 1 cpp file. 

Header files are as follows:
List.h, MDList.h, Notepad.h, Trei.h

All the files have been commented for your ease. Furthermore you may also add further comments if you may. I have uploaded the Visual Studio project file too. You can simply run the project by running "Assignment 2.vcxproj".

#### Furthermore all text files are simply some additional work that we did

For better understanding of the scenerio, refer to "Requirements.md" and "TRIE Overview.pdf".

This was a group project and equal contribution was provided by my fellow team member [Azka Khurram](https://github.com/AzkaKhurram)
